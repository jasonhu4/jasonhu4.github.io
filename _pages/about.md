[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://jasonhu4.github.io/cv2025.pdf)

I am a Ph.D. student working under the guidance of Prof. Jeffrey Fessler and Prof. Liyue Shen at the University of Michigan. My research is in the area of developing generative AI and ML based algorithms for image processing applications. I primarily focus on using score-based diffusion models coupled with deep learning and optimization techniques to solve computational imaging problems. My research efforts consist of imaging applications with collaborations with researchers in medicine, physics, and computer vision, as well as theoretical and foundational analysis of imaging.


**I am currently on the job market for full time positions starting spring 2026.**
